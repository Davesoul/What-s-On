Repository Structure
Ensure your repository is well-organized, with a clear folder structure and necessary files. Here’s an example structure:

plaintext
Copy code
whatson/
├── app.py                 # Flask application script
├── requirements.txt       # List of dependencies
├── Procfile               # For deployment on Render or Heroku
├── .env.example           # Example environment variables (exclude actual keys)
├── README.md              # Project description and setup instructions
├── static/                # Static assets (CSS, JS, images)
├── templates/             # HTML templates (if applicable)
└── docs/                  # Documentation files (optional)
Steps to Set Up GitHub Repository
Create a GitHub repository for your project:

Repository Name: Whats-On
Description: "A personalized conversational AI assistant for real-time news summaries."
Initialize your repository locally and push code:

bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/Whats-On.git
git push -u origin main
README File: Add a clear and detailed README.md:

Project Overview: Include the title, short description, and long description.
Setup Instructions: Detailed steps for running the project locally.
Deployment Link: Link to your hosted app (to be added after deployment).
Acknowledgments: Mention the hackathon and IBM watsonx Assistant.
Demo Application Platform
Option 1: Render (Recommended for Flask Apps)
Render is ideal for Flask-based applications due to its ease of use, scalability, and free tier for small projects.

Set Up Render Account:

Sign up at Render.
Link your GitHub repository to Render.
Deploy Flask App:

Select Web Service in Render.
Configure the following:
Repository: Link your GitHub repository.
Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
Start Command: gunicorn app:app
Add environment variables:
WATSON_API_KEY: Your IBM watsonx API key.
WATSON_URL: Your IBM watsonx endpoint URL.
NEWS_API_KEY: Your NewsAPI key.
Deploy the application. Render will provide a public URL (e.g., https://whatson.onrender.com).
Option 2: Heroku
Heroku is another option for hosting Flask apps, especially if you already have experience with it.

Install Heroku CLI:

bash
Copy code
brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
Prepare for Deployment:

Ensure your repository contains:
requirements.txt: Dependencies.
Procfile: Start command for Heroku (web: gunicorn app:app).
Deploy:

bash
Copy code
heroku create
git push heroku main
Live URL: Heroku will generate a live application link (e.g., https://whatson.herokuapp.com).

Option 3: Other Platforms
If you prefer alternatives, here are some options:

Vercel: Suitable for web apps with static files or serverless functions.
Replit: Best for quick demos or collaborative coding environments.
Application URL
Once your app is deployed on your chosen platform, include the URL in your submission. This URL will allow judges and users to interact with your prototype.

Example:

Render URL: https://whatson.onrender.com
Backup URL (if using Heroku or another platform): https://whatson.herokuapp.com
